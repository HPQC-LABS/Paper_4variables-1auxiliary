\begin_layout Abstract

\lang british
We prove that any function with real-valued coefficients, whose input is
 4 binary variables and whose output is a real number, is perfectly equivalent
 to a 
\emph on
quadratic 
\emph default
function whose input is 5 binary variables and is 
\lang american
minimized
\lang british
 over the new variable.
 Our proof is constructive: we provide quadratizations for all possible
 4-variable functions.
 There exists 4 different classes of 4-variable functions that each have
 their own 5-variable quadratization formula.
 Since we provide `
\lang american
perfect'
\lang british
 quadratizations, we can apply these formulas to any 4-variable subset of
 an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-variable function even if 
\begin_inset Formula $n\gg4.$
\end_inset

 We provide 5 examples of functions that can be 
\lang american
quadratized
\lang british
 using the result of this work.
 For each of the 5 examples we compare the best possible quadratization
 we could construct using previously known methods, to a quadratization
 that we construct using our new result.
 In the most extreme example, the quadratization using our new result needs
 only 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

auxiliary variables for a 
\begin_inset Formula $4N$
\end_inset

-variable degree-4 function, whereas the previous state-of-the-art quadratizatio
n requires 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 (double as many) auxiliary variables and therefore we can reduce by the
 cost of 
\lang american
optimizing
\lang british
 such a function by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{1000}$
\end_inset

 if it were to have 
\begin_inset Formula $4000$
\end_inset

 variables before quadratization.
 In all 5 of our examples, the range of coefficient sizes in our quadratic
 function is smaller than in the previous state-of-the-art one, and our
 coefficient range is a factor of 7 times smaller in our 15-term, 5-variable
 example of a degree-4 function.

Solving such discrete optimization problems with

 Fortunately it is possible to turn any

Quadratization methods exist which can turn an

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 problem into an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 the number of variables does not change) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, but not every function can be turned into a single quadratic function
 with the same global optimum without adding some auxiliary variables (so
 the number of variables in the quadratic problem is usually much more than
 in the original degree-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 problem).
 Discovering better quadratizations (for example with fewer auxiliary variables)
 has been a very active area of research recently: The first quadratization
 method was published in 1975 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, that degree-

 monomials can be quadratized with only 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}\left(\nicefrac{k}{2}\right)$

 auxiliary variables.
 For many functions this can still be prohibitively costly though: If a
 44-variable function has 1 million degree-5 terms and each term requires
 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}\left(\nicefrac{k}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 auxiliary variables for quadratization, the quadratic function will have
 more than 2 million variables (the search space increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{44}\approx10^{13}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{2,000,044}\approx10^{602,073}$

 that sometimes a function of

 variables can entirely be quadratized with only 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}\left(\nicefrac{k}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 auxiliary variables no matter how many terms and how many variables it
 contains (so a 44-variable, degree-5 function with 1 million degree-5 terms
 would only need 2 auxiliary variables rather than 2 million!).
 However, it is only known how to do this very `compact' quadratization
 for a very specific class of functions called

Unfortunately those functions are either extremely obscure functions that
 would rarely come up in a real-world problem.
 , or they are just monomials (meaning that for a real-world problem containing
 many terms, each of these terms would be quadratized separately, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}(k)-1$
\end_inset

 new auxiliary variables being added each time, and adding up to a potentially
 untractable number of total variables in the quadratic optimization problem).

\end_inset

 that it is possible to quadratize multi-term functions so compactly inspired
 us; and the fact that such `compact' quadratizations are only known for
 a very specific category of functions (the AKON functions), motivated us
 to look for quadratizations that are `compact', but also applicable to
 a much wider class of functions.
 The result of this study is the theorem described in the title of this
 paper, and explained in more detail in the section below.
 It allows up to 5 terms of a function (1 of them can be of degree-4 and
 the other 4 can be of degree-3) to be quadratized with only 1 auxiliary
 variable rather than 2 auxiliaries, which used to be the best possible
 quadratization known for such a 5-term function, and is a substantial improveme
nt over the 5 auxiliaries that would be required if quadratizing each term
 individually with 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}\left(\nicefrac{k}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 auxiliary variables for each term.

By `perfect' quadratization we mean all

\end_inset

 output values of the 4-variable function are exactly preserved when minimizing
 over the auxiliary variable in the 5-variable quadratic function.
 Therefore any 4-variable subset of an

\end_inset

 affecting any properties of the much larger

We can also flip more than one bit.
 The corresponding transformations are given by:

\end_inset

We can also verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{1}\circ\varphi_{2}=\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1}$
\end_inset

 so any

 then

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in Q\iff\boldsymbol{\alpha'}\in Q$

 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1234}\ge0$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ijk}$

 according to whether they are 
\begin_inset Formula $\le-\alpha_{1234}$

\begin_inset Formula $\le-\frac{\alpha_{1234}}{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\le0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\ge0$
\end_inset

 We then have 35 different cases (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ijk}$

 can fit into the four different non-overlapping intervals that can be made

\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{\alpha_{1234}}{2}$

 as partition points.
 Some of these cases needs to be further broken down into two subcases depending
 on some sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ijk}+\alpha_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 Only for some of these cases, Lemma 1 can be applied immediately (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in S$
\end_inset

), but thanks to Lemma 2 and Corollary 3, Lemma 1 can be applied to more
 cases after bit-flipping appropriately (i.e.
 there is some sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1},\cdots,i_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{i_{k}}\circ\cdots\circ\varphi_{i_{1}}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})\in S\subseteq Q,$
\end_inset

 which implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in Q$
\end_inset

Pairwise covers would require at least 4 auxiliary variables.
 It is not possible with only 3 auxiliary variables because we cannot cover
 all 9 cubic terms with only 3 auxiliary variables.
 One pairwise cover for the index combinations of this function is 
\begin_inset Formula $\{12,34,35,45\}$
\end_inset

 and since none of the elements contain more than two indices, the quadratizatio
n can be done by Rosenberg's substitution.
 We first define the auxiliary variables:

We note that functions can have multiple different quadratizations, even
 when they have the same number of auxiliary qubits.
 Therefore, while Lemmas 1 constitute the only quadratization formulas needed
 for proving Theorem 1, we considered the possibility that alternative quadratiz
ation formulas exist, but it turned out that all quadratization formulas
 that we found, could by bit-flipping be turned exactly into one of our
 presented formulas.
 Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that other quadratization
 formulas involving only one auxiliary variable can exist: it may just be
 that we have not yet found them.

In particular if alpha_123 <= -alpha_1234 / 2 then alpha_123' >= -alpha_1234
 / 2, and also if alpha_123 >= -alpha_1234 / 2 then alpha_123' <= -alpha_1234
 / 2.
 So if there are at least two cubic coefficients less than -alpha_1234 /
 2, then we can flip two bits and this will change two cubic coefficients
 less than -alpha_1234 / 2 to greater than -alpha_1234 / 2, so we can guarantee
 there is at most one cubic coefficient less than -alpha_1234 / 2.
